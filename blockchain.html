<h1> Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies - IT Technologies </h1>
<p><strong> Alistair Mcleod – s3970979 </strong></p>

<div class="tech1">
<p> The notion of a digital currency has been around for a long time, in fact the first cryptocurrency and by far the most popular, Bitcoin was first proposed by an anonymous figure going by the name of Satoshi back in October 2008. “Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain technology” (Harvard Business Review c. 2017). </p>
<p> Whilst cryptocurrencies have been around now for a while and have even made its way into the mainstream business media not many people truly understand the technology. When hearing the term blockchain what do you immediately think of? The future of finance? A way to get rich quick or possibly a money pit? People boasting about the monkey jpegs they have bought for a ridiculous sum of money? I have completed research to pull the curtains back and explain what this technology does and how it may possibly impact the world. </p>



<br>
<h2> What does it do? </h2>

<p> “Blockchain-based networks, decentralized apps <i>(DApps)</i>, and distributed ledgers are becoming the foundation of much of your digital life” <i>(PC Mag 2017).</i></p>
<p> So firstly, lets explain how blockchain technology works. </p>
<p> Like the name indicates, a blockchain is a chain of blocks containing information which link together to make up a ledger completely open for anyone to see. The type of data stored within a block depends on the type of blockchain. For example, on the bitcoin blockchain you will find the data based on a transaction. This would include details of the sender, recipient and amount of bitcoin transferred. </p>
<p> Each block also contains a hash which is essentially a phrase of digits which identifies a block and all its contents. Each hash is completely unique and acts like a fingerprint. If something within the block gets changed so to will the hash which then indicates a new block is created. Within each block you would also find the hash from the previous block making this blockchain ever connected and making it incredibly easy to track transactions and any changes made on the blockchain. If, for example, I made changes to the third block on a blockchain the hash for that block would then be changed. Each following block however would not house the new hash which has been created essentially making each following block invalid. This concept makes it incredibly hard for data on a blockchain to be tampered with. </p>

<br>

<p> Computers nowadays are incredibly fast so to ensure complete security on a blockchain ledger many blockchains have incorporated a system called Proof of Work <i>(PoW).</i> “Proof of work is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving an arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody from gaming the system” <i>(Investopedia 2022).</i> PoW required users or “miners” on the blockchain to carry out complex mathematical equations to validate the correct hash for a block. “PoW requires nodes on a network to provide evidence that they have expended computational power (i.e. work) in order to achieve consensus in a decentralized manner and to prevent bad actors from overtaking the network” <i>(Investopedia 2022).</i> Each miner is then paid the native cryptocurrency for that blockchain scaling in relation to the amount of work carried out. This incentivises the miners to complete their work honestly and only record correct transactions. One of the greatest drawbacks however from using a PoW system is the extensive amount of energy it requires. Crypto mining energy use alone has led to a larger environmental footprint to that of some countries. </p>

<br>

<p> So now we have an understanding of how the blockchain works and how it is kept so secure what real world uses does this technology come with? One of the main uses of blockchain technology is the development of Smart Contracts. </p>
<p> “Smart contracts are like regular contracts except the rules of the contract are enforced in real-time on a blockchain, which eliminates the middleman and adds levels of accountability for all parties involved in a way not possible with traditional agreements” <i>(Builtin n.d).</i> We have already seen smart contracts utilised for many different functions. AIG and IBM have worked together on a smart contract to “facilitate sharing of real-time information for a main policy written in the United Kingdom, where the bank is headquartered, and three local policies in the United States, Singapore and Kenya” <i>(Reuters 2017).</i></p>
<p> The use of the smart contract in this case is aimed at simplifying ordinarily complex international dealings across sectors. Issuing multinational Insurance coverage can be a slow process due to the red tape involved between different countries. The smart contract is a safe and secure method to allow companies to simultaneously share data in real time drastically reducing time loss and rapidly increasing productivity and profits. </p>

<br>

<p>The finance industry is probably the most at risk of being disrupted by the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. A San Francisco based company, Ripple, has been using blockchain tech to develop a system allowing for global real time payments. Imagine being able to send currency to a relative in the United States and the funds arriving instantly in their digital wallet. No middleman required, all off the back of smart contracts.  </p>

<br>
<h2> What is the likely impact? </h2>

<p>We have already identified some of the ways blockchain tech is being used today. A lot of companies seem to be making the most of how quick smart contracts can be executed and the security behind them. This increase in speed and productivity can have a huge impact on the improvement of global logistics and supply chains. With how connected the world is, multiple countries relying on one another for the distribution and purchase of different goods and commodities, you can imagine how complex today’s supply chains are. As a result of this complexity, blockchain can be an attractive alternative to streamlining this process. “When goods are transferred to a new step in the supply chain, the process can be logged securely and permanently, creating an immutable, auditable history from its point of origin to that of sale” <i>(Getsmarter 2022).</i> </p>


<p>An offshoot of Blockchain technology which has been gaining more and more traction is the introduction of NFT’s or Non Fungible Tokens. “Non-fungible more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing” <i>(The Verge 2022).</i> Whilst the current state of NFT’s is primarily focused on art/profile pictures offering some form of uninspired utility, the future looks bright. The use of NFT’s would be incredibly useful for any environment which requires proof of ownership. This could be easily tracked and proven on the blockchain. Imagine a future in which when purchasing a new house. Rather than needing a new deed to be written up and signed off each time the property is sold the deed would effectively be an NFT passed from owner to owner. Because of the secure nature of the block chain no one would be able to forge house ownership due to the NFT not being able to be altered.</p>

<p> Practically anything that requires proof of ownership could benefit from NFTs. Any transaction that is primarily paper based has become extremely inefficient in todays technological age and also opens the possibility for human error or records/files being lost. Cloud based alternatives are open to the possibility of being hacked or duplicated. The introduction of NFTs offer a possible solution to both of these issues in the future. </p>

<h2> How will this affect you? </h2>

<p> I have been interested in Cryptocurrency for a couple of years now. The current impact on my life is limited to my investments in different coins. Blockchain technology has yet to become widely adopted enough to have an actual impact on how I go about my day to day. I personally have invested money into a few products I believe will positively impact the world and substantially grow over the next few years. Once such company is Ripple (trading as XRP) which has been mentioned earlier in this report. I have a few friends also invested in different cryptocurrencies and we have already experienced both the negative and positives of investing in something so volatile. My first investment was into a ‘meme’ token called Shiba Inu. </p>
<p> It is called a meme token because the token itself doesn’t have its own block chain and also has zero use case. Essentially the price ebbs and flows off the back of hype. I invested not really knowing too much however it just so happened my investment was during a period of community excitement about the possibility of the token being listed on a popular trading application called ‘Robinhood’. This saw my investment triple within a few days. Being completely new to investing I didn’t withdraw my initial investment but rather saw my profits drop back down just as quickly as they went up.  </p>

<p> Whilst my investments have been relatively small, I have friends who have been over leveraged and have lost a fair bit of money during the previous crypto crash. My friend began investing in 2017 which saw a huge rise in crypto prices. Whilst all trading markets go through both bull and bear markets, 2018 saw an incredible sell off of all cryptocurrencies throughout the year after an unprecedented rise the year before. My friend who had seen some success in the year before decided to invest a bulk of his savings into different cryptocurrencies. At the end of the crash he saw a 90% loss on his overall investment pretty much wiping out years of his savings. The 2018 crash, based on percentage was a larger decline than that of the dot com bubble bursting in the early 2000s.  </p>

<br>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

<p>Whether you are a cryptocurrency sceptic or believe decentralization is required to take control away from the 1% and level the playing fields one this is for sure, the opportunity for the implementation of this technology is growing. Over the course of 15 years, we have seen this technology grow to having an almost 1 trillion dollar market cap today. Will we see smart contracts and the blockchain become a staple in the way we do business, or will the crypto bubble fuelled by scepticism finally burst for good? I for one am excited to find out.  </p>
